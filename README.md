Sprint Review and Retrospective Example

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does 
creating user-stories help with this?

Interpreting user needs and implementing them into a program involves understanding the 
users' requirements, preferences, and challenges. I acheived this by taking direct user 
and client feedback. Creating user stories helps by breaking down these needs into clear, 
concise descriptions of desired features or functions from the user perspective. User 
stories provide a way to capture requirements, prioritize tasks, and ensure that the 
development team focuses on delivering value to the user. They are also great tools to 
facilitate communication between stakeholders and developers, ensuring that the final 
product aligns with client and end-user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate
into my future developement work?

I approach developing programs as solving a puzzle, ensuring the best possible ourcome for my end-users. In my future development work, I hope to incorporate Agile processes such as sprints, which allow for iterative development, continuous feedback, and regular adjustments to better meet user needs and enhance overall product quality.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development means continually striving to improve both myself and my teammates. This involves actively collaborating, sharing knowledge, offering constructive feedback, and supporting others to achieve our common goals. It also means being reliable, communicative, and adaptable to ensure the team's success.
